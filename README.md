Generally universities used to have a fleet of buses that various nearby places to that university or college. Majority of faculty and students commute by the university buses. There's always a need to manage the transportation system in terms of locating buses while departing, departure of buses in order, parking order of buses and information to the commuters (in case the buses are not leaving on time due to some reason). The need of communication to the commuters also arises when the buses are combined and the students/ faculty do not get to know which bus they need to board. We propose a smart solution using mobile smart phones to overcome all the above limitations to provide ease and comfort to the commuters.

    The proposed system keeps a record of the parking order of the buses and their respective location which can be checked by the commuters using smartphones.
    The system provides appropriate information to the commuters regarding the departure timings and in case the buses are being combined.
